'''
The goal of this project is to create the game higher or lower. The user will select whether they want to play the game in easy mode or hard mode. In easy mode, the user will have ten attempts to guess the randomly generated number. In hard mode, the user will have five attempts to guess the randomly generated number. When the user makes a guess, the program will tell them if their guess is too high or too low. The game ends when the user guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts.
